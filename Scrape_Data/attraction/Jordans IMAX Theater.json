            "The Jordan's Imax Theater is in itself a complete joy. However, when you enter you will see and hear the great water event in the front lobby ith acompany music.. As you sit you can enjoy superb ice cream or a cheeseburger. Also,entetainment of the young people streamlining over the lobby.Read more",
            "Unfortunately these only show at 7pm. Stores are closed when movie ends so you exit to parking lot. We like to sit in middle of last row. Screen is huge and sound is really good. Chairs even vibrate. Go early and get an ice cream at Richardsons. If Military you can get buy1 get 1 free.Read more",
            "I really like going here for 3D movies intended for the big Screen.  I wish they would offer earlier than 7p starts, on a 3 hour movie. Possibly consider earlier matinees.Read more",
            "Fantastic sound system with great screen and seats that put you into the movie. Usually crowded, and you must exit through the furniture store.Read more",
            "Been coming to Jordan’s since my teens were little. Now as teens it’s the local hangout with friends. Richardsons ice cream, liquid fireworks, imax movies, Fuddruckers, Bean Town and more. Something for everyone!Read more",
            "It's a long and winding path through Jordan's Furniture to the IMAX Theater, and only the first portion is truly well-marked. Of course the IMAX is there for promotional purposes, but . . . better signage along the way could only promote customer goodwill. The theater itself is grand and stadium-style with decent seat pitch (though the seats are no match for the increasingly common luxury models available in many venues), but notwithstanding Eliot Tatelman's on-screen claims that everything here is state of the art, the theater attendant's microphone was broken, and so she shouted, with limited success, about how to safely exit the theater after the show was over. That said, the massive screen image was crisp and impressive, and the \"butt-kicker\" speakers did just that. Read more",
            "I watched infinity war part one and all three hobit films on the big screen. It may take time to reach reading from where I live but the experience is worth the hassle.Read more",
            "I hadn't been to this theater in years but decided to watch one of the releases of the Marvel movies over Labor Day Weekend. This place is hard to find! You have to go through almost the entire Jordan's Furniture store in order to get to the entrance. That being said, it's a lovely theater. They have real small popcorns that are a reasonable size. That alone gets them a star! The screen is curved so no matter where you sit you will get a nice view. This was 2D and a discount price since it was a special event but it looked like their prices were similar to other theaters for new releases and 3D. I'll definitely be returning!Read more",
