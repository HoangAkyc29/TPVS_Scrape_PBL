            "My favorite beach on island!  Crystal clear, calm water.  Changing rooms.  Can watch the sunset over the Caribbean.  Minimal to no seaweed.  Plenty of sea turtles and lots of fish. Great snorkeling.  You can also watch the planes come and go as its located next to the runway.Read more",
            "Local bartender recommended this beach.  Very quiet.  Perfectly still and clear water.  Sea turtles swim right by you.  Since we were here for a work trip, we didn't get to the beach until 4.  We stayed until about 645 pm and it was tricky getting a cab.  So, advice would be to get there earlier when cabs are still plentiful.Read more",
            "This is an amazing beach and it’s free. There’s a restroom and shower area. I was hesitant to visit at first because of some reviews but they were wrong. The beach was clean, the water is calm and crystal clear and the locals were friendly. We got there about 8:30am and I saw my first of about 12-15 turtles within 5 minutes of snorkeling. I also saw a few sting rays and a barracuda along with multiple varieties of fish . There’s plenty of street parking and you are basically on the university campus. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to snorkel and is looking to swim with the turtles.Read more",
            "This beach is near the airport and university so you may not think of it in your planning but the bay has a lot turtles. I would call this more of a local beach. While there are restrooms and showers, that is really all that is available. There are a couple of food trucks with food and drink options. I recommend you bring your own chairs, snorkel gear and an ice chest with drinks and snacks so you can save your money. There a lot of trees so you don't really need to bring a shade. \n\nWe didn't have snorkel gear with us but with the clear water, we could still see the turtles. We wish we had snorkel gear but we still enjoyed the day. Read more",
            "Plan your transportation ahead of you can, we tried to use the public bus but was unable to get reliable information from their website so we ended up walking about a mile then lucked into a taxi back into town ($10 per passenger). We saw it was a good snorkeling sport for sea turtles so we went. We made it about waist deep to shoulder deep and experienced two medium sized sea turtles, several small and medium fish, and a medium sized sting ray. It was the highlight of our day in port and if you're after checking out some wild life this beach has small crowds and plenty of critters from pelicans to turtles.Read more",

            "Our cruise ship docked at Road Town, Tortola, and Brewer‘s Bay was recommended as the best snorkeling beach by the personnel at the taxi information kiosk. Taxi fare was $12 per person each way for our group of 5-6. We arranged a designated pick-up time with our taxi driver, which worked out well. The drive to and from Brewer’s Bay had scenic and beautiful views.The day we visited was rainy, so the beach was empty and the water visibility was better the farther to the right and offshore you went. Do remember that Tortola was hit hard by 2017’s Hurricane Irma, so there is still a lot of devastation. Beers were $5 each at the Nicole’s Beach Bar, and Nicole’s had a decent restroom.  I’m glad we went, because it gave us a glimpse of less touristy areas of Tortola, but we might try Trellis Bay or Cane Garden Bay next time.Read more",
            "Had a great time, water was beautiful. Sea turtles were adorable. This beach isn't one of the main tourist beaches but so worth checking out. Read more",
            "After exploring a few beaches on st. Thomas, this is our favorite so far. Our condo is on sapphire beach, which is amazing, but the surf is much rougher at sapphire. The water was almost completely still at brewer's, making it a great location for snorkeling or using a mask. Unlike other reviewers, we had no issues leaving our belongings on the sand and just floating in the serene waters, searching for shells. The local food trucks are busy, so if you want the good stuff, be out there before noon for food, otherwise it's hotdogs and import beers.Read more",
            "Go early and have the beach to yourself. No amenities but some of the best snorkeling and calm waters around. Saw turtles close enough to pet!Read more",
            "Mostly locals on the beach. Parking is limited and on the street - if you get there in the morning you’ll be fine. We were there on a Wednesday in June and there was a sweet woman in a food truck - cheap prices. Not crowded at all - there were SO many turtles and a few rays. The sand is hot - if you go to the left you’ll be closer to the water. We say further back under the trees for shade. Don’t forget the bug spray. Wonderful beach day!!!Read more"
